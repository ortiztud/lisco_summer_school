# Memory and the Predictive Brain â€“ a Developmental Perspective
## LISCO Lab Summer School 2020

Welcome to the LISCO Lab Summer School on Memory and the Predictive Brain: a Developmental Perspective! In the next two weeks we will learn about different memory systems and their relation to predictions. What types of information can our brains store in the form of memory traces? How are these created, maintained and retrieved or lost? Do these memories help us anticipating what is out there? How does surprise relate to formation of new memories?

If you are intrigued about these questions, join us in the lectures and group sessions: there will be plenty of exciting information for you! 

We will be using this platform to share relevant papers, documents or any other materials that will be used during the summer school.

Find below a summarized schedule and visit our [Wiki](https://github.com/ortiztudelaJ/lisco_sumer_school/wiki) for more details. Also, if you want to know more about us, visit our [Goethe University homepage](http://www.psychologie.uni-frankfurt.de/70500463/Das_Team)

See you soon!
